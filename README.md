# Al's Recipe Galore
Recipe Galore Website - first full-stack project. (no JS framework just pure vanilla JS)

## What made me took interest in this kind of project?
I took this idea as a first step in utilizing all the things I have learned throughout the past few months in full-stack web development, although I haven't used a JS framework yet and this project only consists of pure vanilla JS for the frontend while I used SQL for my database and PHP as a server side backend language. I aim to get my hands dirty in learning different concepts and practices when it comes to web development. This first full-stack project will help me gain feedback from everyone that would spare their time to dive in to see my first project.

## Project Start - End Date:
Currently, I started at Dec 8, 2022 and I expect to finish this project by the end of the month.

## Markup, DB, and Languages Used:
I used HTML, CSS, and pure JS for the frontend while for the backend, I used SQL for my relational database and PHP as my main serverside backend language.
